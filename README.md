Barebones ERC721 Template for Foundry.

Wanted to learn Foundry before getting too accustomed to Hardhat. Followed [this tutorial](https://mirror.xyz/juliancanderson.eth/D94omhhrd4wiWkqSWjY55y-jhtVIBLl9ZZoHk1IERPE) & forked the [abigger87/femplate](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate) template.

## Getting Started

Click `use this template` on [Github](https://github.com/sambarnes/foundry-nft) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if your repo already exists, run:
```sh
forge init --template https://github.com/sambarnes/foundry-nft
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install
```

## Blueprint

```ml

â”œâ”€ ds-test â€” https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test
â”œâ”€ forge-std â€” https://github.com/brockelmore/forge-std
â”œâ”€ openzeppelin-contracts â€” https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
â”œâ”€ solmate â€” https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate

src
â”œâ”€ tests
â”‚  â””â”€ SomeNFT.t â€” "SomeNFT Tests"
â””â”€ SomeNFT â€” "A Minimal ERC721 Contract"
```

## Development


**Setup**
```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).

### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
